# Automate LinkedIn Job Application
This repository demonstrates automation of job application with `selenium`. Page Objects design pattern is used to represent the area where the test interacts within the web application user interface.

**Benefits of using page object pattern:**
- Ease reading test cases
- Create reusable code that can share across multiple test cases
- Reduce the amount of duplicated code
- Eease fixing changes in only one place when the user interface changes
